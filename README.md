# Creating a remote server using DigitalOcean

## Introduction

DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor and we will be using their services to create a remote server that will be running Arch Linux as its operating system (OS). You'll learn how to generate SSH keys, upload a custom Arch Linux Image, use Cloud-init to automate the initial setup, create a Droplet on DigitalOcean, and connect to your server using the SSH keys you have generated. 

### The Goals of This Tutorial
1. Generating SSH keys to have secure access to your server

2. Uploading a custom Arch Linux image to DigitalOcean

3. Creating a cloud-init YAML file to automate setup tasks such as user creation and package installation

4. Creating an Arch Linux Droplet using DigitalOcean

5. Connecting to your Droplet using the SSH keys generated
